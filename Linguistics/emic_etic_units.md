In linguistics and related fields, an **emic unit** is a type of abstract object. Kinds of emic units are generally denoted by terms with the suffix -eme, such as _phoneme, grapheme,_ and _morpheme_.   

The term "emic unit" is defined by Nöth (1995) to mean "an invariant form obtained from the reduction of a class of variant forms to a limited number of abstract units".   

The variant forms are called **etic units** (from phonetic).   

**This means that a given emic unit is considered to be a single underlying object that may have a number of different observable "surface" representations.  

The various etic units that represent a given emic unit of a certain kind are denoted by a corresponding term with the prefix allo- (other, different), such as allophone, allograph, and allomorph.


The most commonly analyzed kinds of emic units in linguistics:  
* A **phoneme** is an underlying object whose surface representations are phones (speech sounds); different phones representing the same phoneme are called **allophones** of that phoneme.   
* A **morpheme** is an underlying object whose surface representations are meaningful fragments of language; different fragments representing the same morpheme are called **allomorphs** of that morpheme.   
* A **grapheme** is an underlying object whose surface representations are graphs (written symbols) [Meletis & Dürscheid, 2022]; different graphs representing the same grapheme are called **allographs** of that grapheme (the term glyph is used in computing, as a synonym of graph).   

Other examples of emic units in various branches of linguistics include the lexeme, grammeme, toneme, chereme, sememe, and tagmeme.
