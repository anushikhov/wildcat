An abjad is a writing system in which only consonants are represented by letter signs, leaving the vowels to be inferred by the reader (unless represented otherwise, such as by diacritics).   

This contrasts with alphabets that provide graphemes for both consonants and vowels. The term was introduced in 1990 by Peter T. Daniels.  

Other terms for the same concept include partial phonemic script, segmentally linear defective phonographic script, consonantary, consonant writing, and consonantal alphabet.   

Impure abjads, such as the Arabic and Hebrew scripts, represent vowels with either optional diacritics or a limited number of distinct vowel graphemes, or both.   

The name abjad is based on the Arabic alphabet's first four letters in their original alphabetical order – corresponding to ʾa, b, j, and d – which reflects the alphabetical order ʾaleph, bet, gimel, dalet in other consonantal Semitic scripts such as Phoenician, Hebrew, and other Semitic proto-alphabets classified within the family of scripts used to write West Semitic languages.   

Impure abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators.
