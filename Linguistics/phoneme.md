A **phoneme** is a set of similar speech sounds that are perceptually regarded by the speakers of a language as a single basic sound - a smallest possible phonetic unit - that helps distinguish one word from another.  

Phonemes are studied under **phonology**, a branch of linguistics (a discipline encompassing language, writing, speech and related matters).
