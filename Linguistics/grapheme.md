In linguistics, a **grapheme** is the smallest functional unit of a writing system.   

The word is derived from Ancient Greek's gráphō ('write'), and the suffix -eme.   

The study of graphemes is called **graphemics**.     

The concept of a grapheme is abstract; it is similar to the notion of a character in computing.
