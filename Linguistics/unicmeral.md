A **unicase** or **unicameral** script is a writing script that has no separate cases for its letters.   
Semitic abjads such as Hebrew and Arabic, Brahmic scripts such as Devanagari, Tamil and Thai, CJK scripts (Chinese characters, Hangul and Kana) and the Iberian and Georgian scripts are unicase writing systems, while scripts like Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Armenian are **bicameral**, as they have two cases for each letter, e.g. B and b, Б and б, Β and β, or Բ and բ.   

Individual characters can also be called unicameral if they are used as letters with a generally bicameral alphabet but have only one form for both cases; for example, the ʻokina as used in Polynesian languages and the glottal stop as used in Nuu-chah-nulth are unicameral.
