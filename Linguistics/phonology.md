**Phonology** is the branch of linguistics that studies how languages systematically organize their phonemes or, for sign languages, their constituent parts of signs.   

The term can also refer specifically to the sound or sign system of a particular language variety. At one time, the study of phonology related only to the study of the systems of phonemes in spoken languages, but now it may relate to any linguistic analysis either:  
* At a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc.), or  
* All levels of language in which sound or signs are structured to convey linguistic meaning.
